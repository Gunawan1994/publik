This project required at least Go version `1.15` because we are using [Go module](https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules) for managing package dependencies. But better if we install the latest version of [Go](https://golang.org).

Need [Docker](https://www.docker.com) to make development easy, execute following command to spin up required service / server for development.

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
